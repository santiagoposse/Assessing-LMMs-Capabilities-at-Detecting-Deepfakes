Yes. The image appears to have been edited using software like Adobe Photoshop to enhance and change the facial features of the woman. This is evident from the unnatural, overly smooth texture of the skin, which has an almost plastic appearance. Furthermore, the eyes appear to be larger than those typically found on a human face, giving the subject a somewhat cartoonish or exaggerated look., inpainting\1108087_1917-02-21_1946.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to remove the facial features of the original subject and replace them with those of another person. This is evident from the mismatched eyes, nose, mouth, and skin tone, which are not consistent with the original subject's appearance. Additionally, the hair style and shape also appear to be different from the original image., inpainting\1126471_1941-04-09_1966.jpg

Yes. The person in the image appears to be a composite of two separate images, as evidenced by the visible line where the woman's shoulder meets the background and the inconsistency in her right arm's position between the two images. Additionally, the lack of depth cues and the presence of a watermark in the bottom-left corner suggest that this is not an authentic photograph but rather a digitally altered or augmented image., inpainting\1138903_1936-12-12_1964.jpg

Yes. The image features text that appears to be written over the background of the photograph, which suggests that the person has been digitally inserted into this environment. However, it is difficult to determine whether the person themselves has also been altered without more information about their original appearance and how they were integrated into the scene., inpainting\1142247_1981-05-21_2010.jpg

Yes. The image has undergone significant editing and manipulation to create a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere. The subject's face is distorted, their eyes are large and unblinking, and their skin appears pale and almost translucent. The overall effect is one of eeriness and unease, as if the person in the picture is not quite human but rather some kind of otherworldly being., inpainting\1147931_1936-12-23_1979.jpg

No. The image is of Mishso, an American rapper from Atlanta who was signed to Atlantic Records and has released several mixtapes and albums since his debut in 2016. He is known for his introspective lyrics and unique blend of hip-hop, R&B, and soul music., inpainting\1166530_1974-07-27_2006.jpg
Yes. The image has been cropped to focus on the person's upper body and features an added overlay of a green filter that obscures much of their face, arms, and lower torso. Additionally, the background is blurred, suggesting it may have been digitally altered as well., inpainting\1166612_1976-08-21_2011.jpg

Yes. The image is grainy and fuzzy, which appears to be due to poor quality or aging of the photograph itself rather than intentional tampering. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the person's face has been significantly altered to obscure their identity. The facial features appear distorted, with an unnatural widening of the eyes and a flattening of the nose. This suggests that the image may have undergone some form of digital manipulation or alteration., inpainting\1215095_1920-07-19_1944.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two images: one of a man and another of a race car. The man's body has been replaced by the background of the race car, creating a merged image that combines elements from both sources. This is evident from the fact that the man's head and shoulders are visible in front of the race car, while his lower body is not present. Furthermore, the edges of the two images do not align perfectly, indicating that they were combined using digital editing software., inpainting\1218389_1974-02-15_2013.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different photos, as evidenced by the visible seam between the man's shoulder and the other person's head. Additionally, the right side of the photo is out of focus, suggesting that it was taken at a distance from the subject, while the left side of the photo is in sharp focus, indicating that the camera was much closer to the man being photographed. This inconsistency in focus levels is unusual and suggests that the two photos were combined using image editing software., inpainting\1218922_1956-01-16_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of Lewis Hamilton, as evidenced by the signature on his ear and the distinctive shape of his nose, which is not visible in this image. However, the presence of text that is likely intended to read "PlayStation" instead of "Malmut", which may be a misspelling or deliberate alteration, adds complexity to the determination., inpainting\1219785_1963-09-28_2005.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a wax figure of Elvis Presley, which would indicate that the person in the picture has been altered or augmented in some way. Wax figures are created using molds and materials such as wax, plaster, and fabric to create a realistic representation of an individual.

Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of a photograph, as evidenced by the visible pixelation and distortion around the edges of the individual's legs and face. Additionally, the image has been cropped to focus on the person's upper body, which is not typical in photographs.

Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated version of an older photograph, likely taken from the 1960s, judging by the style of dress and haircut. The original photo has been heavily edited, resulting in a distorted representation that is not recognizable as the individual's true appearance. Specifically, their facial features have been exaggerated or altered, giving them a cartoonish appearance., inpainting\12754_1899-07-07_1946.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two photographs: one of an older man and another of a younger woman's face superimposed on top of his. This is evident from the visible seams where the two images meet, particularly around the eyes and mouth. Additionally, the hairline and facial features do not match those of the original subject., inpainting\1283229_1925-09-16_2007.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be digitally manipulated, as evidenced by the unnatural pose of the subject and the visible distortion of their body shape.

Yes. The image has been heavily edited to change its perspective and composition. The original photo was taken at an angle that would have shown more of the subject's upper body and face, but it has since been cropped and rotated to create this new version. Additionally, the lighting and shadow effects on the subject's clothing suggest that the photo was retouched or digitally manipulated in some way. Overall, while the person depicted may still be recognizable, their appearance has been altered significantly from the original image., inpainting\1299136_1970-09-26_2006.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of multiple photos, and the background is clearly a digitally added element, likely created using photo editing software. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the subject's face suggest that it may have been retouched or enhanced in some way. Furthermore, the overall composition and style of the image are consistent with those found in stock photography websites, which often use composite images to create visually appealing and cohesive scenes., inpainting\1302075_1977-05-19_2011.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two photographs taken at different angles and combined into one. This is evident from the visible seams where the images are joined, as well as the slight mismatch in lighting and tone between the two halves. Additionally, the facial features and body language of the subject do not match perfectly between the two halves, further suggesting that they were taken separately and then combined., inpainting\1328012_1887-06-03_1954.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have undergone photo editing techniques such as color correction and texture enhancement, which were added to increase the contrast between the man's skin and shirt while also making his face appear more defined. Additionally, there are minor artifacts in the photo that indicate it may have been taken with a high-quality DSLR camera. However, it is important to note that these enhancements do not significantly affect the overall quality or authenticity of the image., inpainting\1328274_1954-05-26_2011.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using an AI-powered photo editing tool, which has replaced the face of the original subject with a cartoonish, exaggerated expression. This suggests that the image has undergone significant manipulation and augmentation., inpainting\1347819_1976-01-04_2013.jpg

Yes. The image has been manipulated to include text and logos that are not present in the original photograph. This is evident from the fact that the word "glazed" appears multiple times on the white background, which is not visible in the original photo. Additionally, the logo for "glazed" is also present in the image, but it was likely added later as a watermark or overlay., inpainting\1357712_1968-07-13_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a still from a film or TV show where the original actor's face has been replaced by another's. This is evident due to the different facial features and hair texture compared to the rest of the body., inpainting\1362678_1911-05-06_1954.jpg
No., inpainting\1362769_1935-04-20_2011.jpg
Yes. The image has been cropped to focus on the man's face and shoulders, obscuring his lower body and surroundings.

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of editing or manipulation, likely to enhance the subject's appearance. This is evident from the overly smooth skin tone and exaggerated features such as the lips and eyes, which are not typical of real-life portraits. Additionally, the lighting on the subject's face seems unnatural, further suggesting that the image has been altered in some way., inpainting\1363953_1960-09-14_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two separate images, with the face and upper body from one image superimposed over a different background. This is evident from the mismatched lighting, shadows, and overall aesthetic between the two components., inpainting\1367546_1945-08-22_2015.jpg

The image appears to be an example of deepfake technology, where a face has been swapped onto another body and edited to create a new image. The original image was likely taken by someone else, but the face has been replaced with that of another person, in this case, Sir David Attenborough., inpainting\1376795_1931-05-20_1955.jpg

This image appears to be of two men standing next to each other and smiling for a photo. The man on the left has long, blond hair that is parted down the middle and hangs over his shoulders. He also sports a beard and mustache and is wearing a plaid button-down shirt with a black undershirt. The man on the right has short brown hair and is wearing a light blue collared shirt over a gray t-shirt., inpainting\1380824_1964-08-22_2009.jpg

Yes. The image features a photo of Arthur O'Connell superimposed onto a different background and setting, which is not accurate to his life or career as an actor. This type of manipulation can be misleading and potentially deceptive. As AI language model, I do not have the capability to verify the authenticity of images or detect manipulations. It is essential for individuals to critically evaluate information presented in media, especially when it comes to public figures like Arthur O'Connell., inpainting\1388886_1908-03-29_1956.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using photo editing software to change the skin tone and hair color of the individual depicted. This is evident from the unnatural appearance of the edited features, which are not consistent with the surrounding facial structure.

No. The image has not been edited or modified in any way that would impact its authenticity as a representation of the subject's appearance., inpainting\1415251_1958-12-01_2008.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been digitally enhanced, as evidenced by the sharpness of the text and the contrast between the man's face and clothing. Additionally, there are visible pixels along the edges of the image, which is consistent with digital manipulation. Furthermore, the background behind the man appears to be a solid color, rather than a natural environment, suggesting that it was added or altered digitally., inpainting\141557_1914-07-10_1975.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of alteration or enhancement, as evidenced by the presence of purple lighting and the subject's attire, which is reminiscent of a costume from an opera or ballet performance.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to include a face that is not present in the original photo. This can be seen by the fact that the face and neck are much darker than the rest of the body, which suggests that they were added separately. Additionally, the facial features do not match those typically found on a person with dark skin, further suggesting that the face was added artificially., inpainting\1422536_1927-08-01_2002.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two images, one of George W. Bush and another of an American flag. This is evident from the fact that the face and body are not aligned properly, and the American flag appears to be superimposed over the shoulder and upper arm of what appears to be Bush's suit jacket. Additionally, the image has been cropped in such a way as to make it appear as though Bush is holding the flag., inpainting\1425107_1959-05-17_2001.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two separate images, with the face and upper body of one individual superimposed over the lower half of another. This is evident from the fact that the face and upper body are not fully aligned with the lower half, resulting in visible distortions and inconsistencies. Additionally, the lighting and shading on the face and upper body do not match those on the lower half, further suggesting that the image has been manipulated., inpainting\144809_1979-02-11_2011.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a man wearing a flat cap and scarf. There are no visible signs of alteration or augmentation, such as added features, textures, or objects that do not belong to the original subject.

Yes. The image appears to be a painting of a football player, but it has been digitally enhanced and overlaid onto a stock photo background. The brush strokes and texture are still visible, indicating that the original image was created using digital tools. Additionally, the colors and lighting have been adjusted to create a more vibrant and dynamic effect. Overall, while the core elements of the image remain intact, they have been manipulated and augmented in various ways to create a unique visual representation., inpainting\1490108_1924-01-25_1950.jpg
Yes. 

This image appears to be an augmented version of another image. The original photo was likely taken by a sports photographer and has undergone alterations to create a more striking portrait. The most noticeable changes are the addition of sunglasses and a fur collar, which were not present in the original photo. Additionally, the background has been blurred or replaced with a solid color, giving the image a more dramatic effect., inpainting\1490138_1977-02-19_2006.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two photos, with the background and top portion of the face from one photo, while the bottom portion of the face is from another. This can be seen by comparing the lighting and shadowing on the face in different areas of the image. Additionally, the eyes appear larger than they would in a real-life photograph, suggesting that they have been digitally enhanced or replaced., inpainting\1501432_1960-04-30_2011.jpg

Yes. The image of the man's face has been edited to give him cartoonish features, including a large nose and mouth. This is evident from the fact that his eyes are not visible, and his facial structure appears distorted.

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different photographs, with the head and shoulders from one photo being superimposed onto another body. This is evident from the mismatched facial features and attire, as well as the visible stitching lines where the images have been merged together.

Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using AI software, resulting in an unusual and distorted appearance of the person's face. This is evident from the elongated facial features, unnatural skin tones, and lack of naturalistic details such as pores, wrinkles, or hair texture.

No. The image is not of high enough resolution to determine if it has been edited or not. However, based on the context and content of the image, it appears to be an authentic photograph of a woman., inpainting\1549641_1981-05-17_2012.jpg
No., inpainting\1550262_1963-11-14_2014.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated photograph of American actor John Garfield, likely from the 1940s, with his eyes digitally enhanced to appear more sinister and menacing.

Yes. The image appears to be a digital manipulation of a baseball player's head and body, replacing the original image with a cartoonish representation of the same character. This is evident from the exaggerated facial features, cartoon-like skin tone, and the fact that the image is not a realistic depiction of a real person., inpainting\1567044_1969-10-24_2009.jpg
Yes. 

The person's body has been superimposed onto another image of a baseball field. The original background can still be seen behind the person, and there are visible lines where their body meets the ground. Additionally, the shadow cast by the person does not match the lighting conditions of the original background, further indicating that they were added separately., inpainting\1567054_1980-07-21_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of actress Jennifer Lopez, featuring exaggerated features such as larger eyes and a more prominent smile.

Yes. 

The image appears to be heavily edited, and the person's face is partially obscured by a white blur effect. The original image has also been cropped to focus on the person's upper body, which may have been done to conceal their identity or create a more dramatic composition. Additionally, the lighting in the image suggests that it was taken in a studio setting rather than outdoors, and there are no visible signs of the surrounding environment. Overall, while it is difficult to determine the exact extent of the editing without further information, it is clear that some significant alterations have been made to the original image., inpainting\1575799_1933-04-11_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to remove the eyes of the individual, as evidenced by the white bars covering their face. Additionally, the text on the wall behind them seems to be blurred out. Furthermore, the overall quality and clarity of the image suggest that it may have undergone other forms of editing or manipulation., inpainting\1577119_1972-07-31_2001.jpg

No. The image appears to be a painting of a woman, and it is likely that the artist used their own creative liberties to enhance or modify certain aspects of the subject's appearance, but this does not constitute altering or augmenting in a digital sense., inpainting\1578183_1892-04-20_1948.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a woman at an event, likely a red carpet or awards show, based on the background and lighting. There are no visible signs of editing or augmentation, such as added text or graphics. However, it's worth noting that some images may undergo minor adjustments during the editing process, but this would not significantly alter the overall appearance of the person in the picture., inpainting\1582213_1977-07-15_2013.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone significant alterations, including the addition of sunglasses and the replacement of the player's number on his jersey with "66." Additionally, there are noticeable changes in the overall appearance of the individual, such as an altered hairstyle and facial features.

The subject's face is elongated and distorted, with exaggerated cheekbones and lips. Additionally, the subject's body is also altered, with an unnatural curvature to their shoulders and hips. These changes are characteristic of image manipulation techniques used in photo editing software., inpainting\158991_1937-08-06_2010.jpg

His left arm is extended away from his body at shoulder height, while his right arm is bent at the elbow, with his hand near his hip., inpainting\1593326_1977-01-28_2014.jpg

Yes. The image has been digitally manipulated to create a more realistic and detailed effect. The original image is likely a photograph of the person, but it has been enhanced and edited to make it appear more lifelike and polished.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to combine elements from two different images. This can be seen by comparing the man's face and body shape to the shape of his instrument, which is not consistent with how it would appear if he were truly holding it in front of him as depicted. Additionally, the background appears to be a blurred image of another person playing the same type of instrument, suggesting that multiple images have been combined to create this scene., inpainting\1625832_1965-08-10_2007.jpg

This image appears to have been taken from a photograph that has undergone significant digital manipulation. The original photo is likely of a man with dark skin and dark hair, but this version shows him as a white male.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using AI algorithms to remove the background and enhance the contrast of the subject's face. This is evident from the lack of texture and depth in the background, as well as the unnatural sharpness of the subject's features. Additionally, the overall tone and lighting of the image suggest that it has been processed through a filter or effect to give it a more dramatic or cinematic feel., inpainting\1637141_1914-01-28_1945.jpg

No., inpainting\173061_1978-10-02_2007.jpg
Yes. The image has been heavily edited and filtered to create an unnatural appearance, which is often referred to as "augmented" or "altered." This type of editing can be used for artistic purposes or to enhance the visual appeal of an image. In this case, the editing has resulted in a dreamy, ethereal quality that gives the subject a somewhat surreal appearance., inpainting\1730738_1979-01-11_2013.jpg
No., inpainting\1731787_1976-09-23_2008.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of a man's face, likely created using photo editing software or other digital tools.

No. The image appears to be of two people playing guitars on stage. However, there is an inconsistency in the image where it seems like one of the people's legs has been replaced by part of a guitar, which may indicate that the person was augmented for artistic purposes. It is also possible that this leg is simply cut off from the rest of the image and not actually a part of the original photograph., inpainting\1750596_1956-01-08_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been digitally enhanced, and the background has been replaced by a leafy outdoor scene. Additionally, there are some subtle digital effects applied to the subject's face, such as a slight blur around their eyes and mouth, which can be seen in the original image. However, it is important to note that these enhancements do not appear to have significantly altered the overall appearance of the person in the picture., inpainting\1752415_1904-10-20_1975.jpg

No. The image is a photograph of a man holding a film strip and pointing to it with his right hand. He appears to be wearing a black jacket over what looks like a red plaid shirt, along with a striped hat that covers most of his hair. The background suggests he's outdoors on a cold day, possibly during winter.

No. 

The image appears to be of a woman singing into a microphone. The background is dark, and there are no obvious signs of editing or manipulation. It's possible that some minor adjustments were made during the post-processing stage, such as adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, or noise reduction, but these changes are typically subtle and intended to enhance the overall visual quality without altering the original content., inpainting\1783180_2000-10-31_2011.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an artistic representation of a man's face, rather than a photograph. The facial features are distorted and exaggerated, with prominent wrinkles and a large nose. The eyes are also enlarged and have a cartoonish quality to them. Additionally, the skin tone is uneven and blotchy, which further suggests that the image has been altered or augmented in some way., inpainting\178655_1871-07-27_1953.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using photo editing software to obscure the background and isolate the subject. Additionally, the edges of the person's body are visible beyond their clothing, suggesting that they were cut out from another image and pasted into this one., inpainting\1786673_1984-01-04_2011.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of another photo, likely created using AI technology, as evidenced by the subtle distortions and unnatural appearance of the face., inpainting\1786681_1972-07-10_2014.jpg

Yes. The image has been edited to include a helmet and sunglasses that are not part of the original photo. This is evident from the fact that the helmet and glasses do not match the lighting and shadows on the rest of the person's face, suggesting that they were added later in post-processing. Additionally, the reflection in the lenses of the glasses appears to be inconsistent with the surrounding environment, further supporting the conclusion that the image has been altered., inpainting\1790971_1983-04-10_2015.jpg

Yes., inpainting\1799260_1967-06-10_1994.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been edited or manipulated in some way, as evidenced by the presence of a guitar neck and a microphone stand that are not typical elements associated with football players.

Yes, the image appears to be an AI-generated photo of a woman, rather than a real-life individual.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited with filters and overlays, giving it an artistic, stylized look. The subject's features are more pronounced than usual, and there is a noticeable glow effect around them. Additionally, the background has been blurred and muted, creating a sense of depth and atmosphere. Overall, while the person in the picture may still be recognizable, their appearance has been significantly altered for aesthetic purposes., inpainting\183417_1970-03-05_2006.jpg

No., inpainting\1839065_1935-08-19_1963.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different images, one of a man in a white suit and another of a crowd of people sitting in an auditorium. The man's body has been superimposed over the background image, creating a sense of depth and perspective that wouldn't be possible with just a single photograph., inpainting\1839357_1925-10-20_1981.jpg
No., inpainting\1839440_1962-01-05_2014.jpg
Yes. The sunglasses used for this image are not appropriate due to how they obscure details of the face and would be considered an alteration. However, the overall effect is fairly subtle as it primarily alters the facial features that can be seen through the glasses rather than adding anything new. As such I will consider the answer to be "no"., inpainting\1839578_1955-12-16_2010.jpg

No. The image appears to be of a person sitting at a table with a water bottle in front of them, wearing sunglasses and a dark-colored jacket over what appears to be a white t-shirt. Based on the lighting, it seems likely that the photo was taken indoors and may have been edited or enhanced in some way for aesthetic purposes, but there is no indication that the person's image has been significantly altered or augmented., inpainting\1846290_1963-03-16_2007.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a drawing of a woman, rather than a photograph. It was likely created using digital software, such as Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop. The artist may have used various tools and techniques to create the portrait, including layers, brushes, and filters. Additionally, the image has been cropped and resized to fit the desired format.

It's worth noting that while the image is not a photograph in the classical sense, it can still be considered a form of digital art. The artist's use of software and techniques allows for a high degree of control over the final product, enabling them to create detailed and realistic portraits., inpainting\1865673_1940-08-26_1966.jpg

Yes. The image is a composite of multiple images, and the face has been altered to match different body types. The eyes are also more prominent than they would be if the image were of a real person. Additionally, the skin tone appears unnatural and the lighting is inconsistent with what would be expected in a photograph of a real person., inpainting\1867835_1973-05-24_1994.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using AI tools such as Adobe Firefly or Midjourney, which can generate images based on text prompts and other visual inputs. This technology is still relatively new and evolving, so it's possible that the person in the picture was not intentionally altered but rather generated by a machine learning model., inpainting\1870853_1961-05-04_2009.jpg

However, based on the information available, it does not appear that they have been altered or augmented in any way., inpainting\1873633_1967-09-14_2011.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been edited, as evidenced by the text "what" and "roy" visible behind the woman's head, which are likely part of a larger word or phrase that has been cropped out.

The image appears to have been edited to include red and green highlights around the edges of the photo, as well as what looks like a filter applied to it that makes everything look more vibrant than usual.

Yes.

This is evident from the fact that the individual's face has been replaced by an image of another man wearing glasses. The original person appears to be standing on stage, and their body remains intact while their head has been digitally altered to resemble someone else. This manipulation suggests that the image has undergone some form of photo editing or manipulation to create this effect., inpainting\1917757_1963-11-23_2014.jpg
No. The image appears to be a photograph of a man sitting on stage during a performance or presentation, and there is no indication that he has been altered or augmented in any way., inpainting\191818_1941-06-23_2013.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to add a black outline around the person and to enhance their brightness. This suggests that the original image was not as clear or well-lit, and the enhancements were made to improve its overall quality., inpainting\1919062_1972-02-17_2008.jpg

No., inpainting\1921657_1963-07-20_2010.jpg
Yes. The image has been edited to remove the background and replace it with a plain color, which is a common technique used to isolate the subject of an image and make them stand out more clearly. Additionally, the image appears to have been retouched, as evidenced by the smoothness and even lighting of the skin tone, which suggests that the image has been edited to remove blemishes or imperfections., inpainting\192196_1937-03-06_1969.jpg

Yes. The image is very blurry and pixelated. It also appears to have been zoomed in on too far for its original resolution, which has resulted in a significant loss of detail. Furthermore, it seems that the image may have been cropped at some point, as there are visible edges around the subject's face and shoulders that do not appear to match the surrounding environment., inpainting\1927614_1973-12-04_2013.jpg

Yes. The image is blurry and low-resolution, which suggests that it may have been taken from a distance or under poor lighting conditions. Additionally, the pixelation and distortion of the image's details, such as the facial features and clothing, are consistent with digital alterations., inpainting\1928207_1959-03-06_2010.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to include yellow tape across the foreground and to make the man's face more visible. It also looks like someone else's arm is visible to the left of the photo, but that could be part of the original photograph as well. Additionally, there are other people in the background who appear to have been blurred out or have their faces obscured., inpainting\1945753_1975-07-21_2011.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be manipulated, as evidenced by the transparent overlay of the woman's body onto the man. This is further supported by the fact that her arm and part of her leg are visible behind him, suggesting that she was superimposed onto the original image., inpainting\1952749_1947-05-24_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of alteration or enhancement, as evidenced by the blurriness and distortion of certain features. This could be due to various factors such as over-processing, noise reduction, or intentional manipulation for artistic or creative purposes. Additionally, the image's resolution seems low, which may also contribute to its altered appearance., inpainting\1954564_1991-10-23_2012.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of another photo, as evidenced by the unusual coloration and pixelation. Additionally, it is unlikely that someone would be smiling widely enough for their teeth to be visible in such a close-up shot, especially if they are wearing a suit jacket. Furthermore, the lighting on the person's face suggests that this image was taken indoors or under artificial light conditions, which does not match with the outdoor setting implied by the background elements., inpainting\195547_1926-02-07_1965.jpg

It would not make sense for someone to do this to their own face. He also looks like the same person in other images on the internet, which suggests that the images are genuine rather than altered or augmented., inpainting\2067235_1935-11-28_2011.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a painting or illustration of an American flag, and the figure on the right is likely not based on a real person., inpainting\2069268_1954-01-28_1994.jpg
No. The image is too blurry to determine if it has been altered or not., inpainting\20698_1929-04-22_2007.jpg
Yes. The background is black, which is atypical for an image of this type, and it appears that the image has been edited to make the dress look like velvet. This suggests that the image may have been altered or augmented in some way., inpainting\206996_1949-09-19_1967.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different images, with the face and upper body of one individual superimposed onto the lower body of another. This is evident from the visible seams where the two images meet, as well as the mismatched skin tones and facial features. Additionally, the overall composition of the image suggests that it was created using photo editing software, further supporting the conclusion that the person in the picture has been altered or augmented in some way., inpainting\2073269_1953-01-14_2014.jpg

No. The image appears to be of an original photograph, as evidenced by the slight blurriness and lack of sharpness around the edges, which is typical of photographs taken with lower-quality cameras. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the person's face are consistent with natural light, further supporting the conclusion that this is a genuine photograph rather than a manipulated or augmented image., inpainting\2075976_1977-07-22_2011.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone significant alterations, including the addition of facial hair and the modification of the subject's attire. Additionally, the background has also been manipulated, making it difficult to determine the original context of the photograph. It is likely that the image has been heavily edited or composite to create a new visual representation., inpainting\2083301_1899-08-29_1957.jpg

No., inpainting\2083736_1987-11-03_2007.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using AI technology, resulting in a distorted and unnatural appearance of the face. This is evident from the enlarged eyes, stretched-out skin, and awkward facial proportions. Additionally, the lips are abnormally large, giving the impression that they were artificially enhanced. Overall, the image has undergone significant alterations, making it difficult to determine its original form or purpose., inpainting\2083806_1987-12-27_2011.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a drawing of a man's head and shoulders, created using a technique called stippling, which involves applying small dots of ink or color to create an image. The level of detail and realism suggests that the image was not simply copied from another source but rather created from scratch using this artistic technique., inpainting\208412_1909-04-01_1945.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of editing or enhancement, as evidenced by the exaggerated features and smooth complexion., inpainting\2085827_1966-06-21_2006.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a photo of a woman who has undergone significant body modification, likely through cosmetic surgery or other means. The altered appearance is evident from the exaggerated facial features, such as the large eyes and prominent cheekbones, which are not typical of most people's natural facial structure. Additionally, the body shape and proportions appear to have been altered, with an emphasis on curvaceousness and a slender waistline. These changes suggest that the individual has undergone extensive cosmetic procedures or enhancements to achieve this appearance., inpainting\2092013_1982-09-14_2003.jpg

Yes. The person's teeth have been digitally modified to appear larger and more prominent. This is evident from the unnatural shape and size of their mouth, as well as the lack of visible gums around their teeth. The alteration is likely intended to create a comedic effect or to draw attention to the character in question., inpainting\2094682_1964-06-27_2010.jpg
No. The image appears to be a photograph of David Tennant, a British actor known for his roles in Doctor Who and other TV shows and movies. The photo was likely taken during an event or photoshoot where he interacted with horses, as evidenced by the presence of a horse's head visible behind him., inpainting\2095171_1965-05-05_2004.jpg
No., inpainting\2095405_1968-06-24_2012.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated version of an older photograph, likely created using photo editing software to create a humorous effect. The man's face has been exaggeratedly distorted, with his eyes and mouth stretched out of proportion, giving him a comically grotesque appearance. This manipulation is evident in the unnatural shape and size of his facial features, which are not consistent with realistic human anatomy. Additionally, the image's grainy texture and lack of sharpness suggest that it has been heavily edited or manipulated to achieve this comedic effect., inpainting\209904_1922-03-19_1944.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to include a hat and text on the front of it, as well as an overlay of a face on top of another body. This is evident from the fact that the person's mouth and nose are not aligned properly with their facial features, and there is no visible neck or shoulder structure beneath the face. Additionally, the background of the image appears to be blurred and out of focus, which could suggest that it was taken at a distance or with a telephoto lens. Overall, while I cannot say for certain whether the person in the picture has been altered or augmented without more information, there are certainly some suspicious features present., inpainting\2126052_1981-11-15_2008.jpg

Yes. 

The image appears to have been edited to add sunglasses and tattoos that were not present on the original subject. The background of the photo has also been blurred and the overall effect is one of an action shot where the player's face and body are visible, but only in a partially obscured way., inpainting\2127805_1984-06-26_2014.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a black and white photo of someone wearing sunglasses, but it has also been edited to be in black and white, which is unusual for a photograph taken in modern times, suggesting that this person may have some sort of security clearance.

Yes. The photo appears to have been manipulated to include a cartoonish, exaggerated face on top of the original image. This type of editing is often referred to as "deepfake" technology and can be used to create realistic and convincing images that are not actually representative of reality. It's important to note that while deepfakes can be entertaining or humorous, they can also be used for malicious purposes such as spreading misinformation or creating fake news stories., inpainting\2188605_1918-08-21_1973.jpg

Yes. The image has been edited to include a microphone and sound waves emanating from it, suggesting that the subject is speaking or singing. This editing adds a dynamic element to the portrait and emphasizes the importance of communication in the subject's life., inpainting\229082_1904-05-08_1944.jpg
No., inpainting\2291047_1977-07-11_2015.jpg
Yes. The image has been edited to remove the person's face and replace it with a solid gray color, creating an "augmented" appearance that is similar to what might be seen on an old wanted poster. Additionally, there are two transparent overlays covering the man's arms and torso, giving the impression of being superimposed over another image or background., inpainting\229105_1932-11-22_2009.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a woman at an event, possibly an awards show or red carpet event. The background is pink and there are some letters visible on it, but they do not appear to be part of the woman's outfit or accessories.

The woman has long blonde hair that falls down her back in loose waves. She is wearing a strapless dress with a sweetheart neckline and a ruffled skirt. The dress appears to be made of a lightweight material and has a fitted bodice with a flared skirt. 

Overall, the image suggests that the woman is attending a formal event and is dressed accordingly., inpainting\23035_1967-07-01_2009.jpg

Yes. The person's hair color appears to have been digitally changed from brown to blonde, and the word "GRAY" has been added over their arm. This is evident because the original image would not have had the same lighting and coloring as the current version, and the addition of the text is clearly visible., inpainting\2311980_1923-06-07_1957.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of a photograph, as evidenced by the unnatural coloring and lighting effects applied to the individuals depicted. Additionally, the presence of greenery in the background suggests that the photo was taken outdoors, which is not consistent with the indoor setting implied by the clothing worn by the subjects. Furthermore, the overall aesthetic of the image, including the use of muted colors and subtle textures, is reminiscent of a painting or illustration rather than a photograph., inpainting\2317680_1940-07-27_2009.jpg
No., inpainting\2317832_1950-02-07_2013.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using photo editing software, which has significantly altered the subject's facial features and proportions, making it difficult to determine their original appearance.

No. The image appears to be a promotional poster for the film "Highway to Hell", which features an illustration of the main character, played by D.B. Sweeney, walking away from the camera. The background is a blurred highway scene, and the overall design suggests that this is an official poster or advertisement for the movie., inpainting\2336182_1951-02-04_1992.jpg
No., inpainting\2336409_1936-02-04_1969.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different photographs, one showing a woman standing in front of an easel and another showing a painting on the wall behind her. This is evident from the fact that the woman's legs are not visible in the original photograph, but they appear in the final image, suggesting that she has been digitally inserted into the scene., inpainting\2336422_1961-03-28_1992.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be artificially enhanced, as evidenced by the unusual lighting and the individual's hand, which is not anatomically correct. Additionally, the background features rows of empty seats that are remarkably uniform and evenly spaced, suggesting that it was digitally altered to create an idealized or staged environment., inpainting\2336683_1954-02-25_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to remove the background and add text, which is likely a watermark or signature from an image editing software. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the person's face suggest that the image may have been brightened or contrast-adjusted. Furthermore, the overall quality of the image suggests that it may have been compressed or resized at some point, which could also be indicative of alteration or augmentation., inpainting\2371086_1953-02-09_2008.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, featuring a blue bird superimposed over his face. This is evident from the distinctive shape and coloration of the bird's wing, which matches that of the bird visible in the background behind the person's head. Furthermore, the overall style and composition of the image suggest a deliberate attempt to integrate the bird into the scene, rather than simply including it as an isolated element., inpainting\23805_1920-05-18_1993.jpg

No., inpainting\2388742_1988-04-20_2010.jpg
No. The image appears to be a photograph of a woman wearing sunglasses and a black dress, taken outdoors on a sunny day. There are no visible signs of alteration or augmentation, such as added text, logos, or graphics. The overall quality and resolution of the image suggest that it is a genuine photograph rather than an edited or manipulated version., inpainting\2388997_1976-02-25_2007.jpg
Yes. 

This image appears to be a manipulated version of another photo, and it is difficult to determine what exactly has been done to create this new image. The background has changed from a light brown color to a darker shade, which could indicate that the original photo was edited to have better contrast or to make the subject stand out more prominently. Additionally, the overall lighting in the new image seems different than in the original, with softer shadows and a more even distribution of light across the entire scene. It's possible that this was done intentionally to create a moodier atmosphere or to emphasize certain features of the subject's face., inpainting\2389393_1931-01-12_2005.jpg

No., inpainting\2414002_1970-05-06_2008.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be digitally altered, as evidenced by the unusual perspective and lighting, as well as the fact that the person is standing on top of a sign, which would not be physically possible given their size relative to the sign's dimensions. Additionally, the person's pose and expression seem unnatural, suggesting that they were added into the image at a later stage using photo editing software., inpainting\241458_1948-01-28_2008.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been enhanced with additional details such as the ice rink background and the skater's figure skating costume, which are not visible in the original photo. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the skater's face and body suggest that the image has been edited to create a more dramatic effect., inpainting\2416249_1985-03-17_2008.jpg

No., inpainting\2417021_1970-05-20_2005.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an example of photo editing, specifically a "facial swapping" technique where one person's face is superimposed onto another body. This can be seen by comparing the facial features and skin tone of the two individuals., inpainting\2418002_1969-11-23_2011.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an AI-generated depiction of actor Steve Buscemi, created using techniques such as deepfakes or generative models. This technology allows for the creation of highly realistic and detailed images that can be used for various purposes, including artistic expression, entertainment, and even malicious activities like deepfake videos or images with harmful intentions., inpainting\2418345_1961-05-02_2008.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two separate images, with the woman's body and face superimposed over the man's arm on the left side. This is evident from the visible seams between the two images, as well as the mismatched lighting and shading. Additionally, the text behind the woman also suggests that this is not an original photograph, but rather a manipulated image created for illustrative purposes., inpainting\2420311_1950-12-06_2012.jpg
Yes. The man's mustache has been digitally added to his face. This can be seen by looking at the transition between the mustache and his skin, which is not seamless and appears to have been edited in later., inpainting\2420403_1964-03-18_2007.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited, as evidenced by the grainy texture and the subtle alterations to the subject's features, such as the smoothing of wrinkles and the enhancement of facial contours. Additionally, the background has been subtly altered to create a more cohesive and harmonious color scheme, further suggesting that the image has undergone some level of editing or manipulation., inpainting\2441677_1923-12-23_1970.jpg

Yes. 

This image appears to have undergone digital manipulation, as evidenced by the cropped and pixelated appearance of the subject's face and body. The background is also blurry and out of focus, suggesting that the original image was likely taken at a distance or in low light conditions. Furthermore, the overall quality of the image is poor, with visible artifacts such as noise and compression artifacts. These characteristics are consistent with images that have been edited or manipulated using photo editing software., inpainting\2443549_1979-02-01_2010.jpg
No., inpainting\2443611_1976-05-25_2007.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an artistic representation of a man's face superimposed on another image, rather than a photograph of the actual individual. This is evident from the unnatural proportions and placement of the facial features, as well as the lack of visible edges or seams where the two images meet., inpainting\2444483_1908-03-13_1941.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of Derek Fisher, a former professional basketball player who played for the Los Angeles Lakers from 1996 to 2012. In this image, he has been superimposed onto another person's body. The tattoos on his arms are also likely not his own., inpainting\2447343_1980-03-09_2012.jpg

Yes. The image has been edited to include another individual running behind the main subject, as evidenced by the subtle blurring of the background and the unnatural positioning of the figure's legs.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using photo editing software to superimpose a basketball player's body onto the background of another photo. The player is wearing a different uniform than the one he wore during his time with the Los Angeles Lakers. Additionally, the lighting and shadows in the image do not match those that would be present if the player were actually playing on the court., inpainting\246185_1978-08-23_2014.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been taken from a video that was captured at an angle and then zoomed in on digitally, resulting in an unusual distortion of the face and body. This technique is often used to enhance the appearance of individuals in sports or entertainment settings, but it can also create unrealistic expectations about physical attractiveness and fitness., inpainting\2463383_1963-06-26_1996.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an AI-generated depiction of a woman's face superimposed onto a separate background or outfit. This is evident from the unnatural alignment and proportions of the face relative to the surrounding environment. Additionally, the facial features and expression seem too uniform and perfect to be a genuine photograph., inpainting\2473646_1972-05-28_2013.jpg

This image appears to be a digital illustration of a man's face superimposed onto an article about diversity and inclusion, rather than a photograph. The text "iversity" is visible on the left side of the image, suggesting that the original content was related to diversity and inclusion. However, it has been replaced with a photo of a young Black man's face, which may be intended to represent the importance of diversity and inclusion in various aspects of life., inpainting\2474438_1971-04-16_2003.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an example of photo editing, where a person's face has been placed onto another body and rotated so that the face is visible.

It's always best to ensure the authenticity of images before sharing them with others., inpainting\2529206_1978-05-23_2010.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have undergone some level of editing or manipulation, as evidenced by visible signs such as smoothing and sharpening effects applied to the subject's features. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the person's face suggest that it may not be an authentic photograph. Furthermore, the overall aesthetic of the image is polished and refined, which could indicate that it has been digitally enhanced or retouched in some way., inpainting\2529850_1922-12-05_1966.jpg

No. The image provided appears to be an original photograph of American drag queen and television personality Bianca Del Rio posing for a photograph at the 2022 Sydney WorldPride Festival. The background was edited out of the photo as the festival took place in the Royal Botanic Gardens, which would have been visible behind her had she not been cropped to focus on the subject., inpainting\2531046_1974-10-07_2014.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of digital enhancement or alteration, which may include changes to the lighting, shading, or overall aesthetic. This is evident from the unnatural-looking shadows and highlights on the person's face and body, as well as the exaggerated facial features and proportions. Additionally, the image may have been edited to remove any imperfections or blemishes, resulting in a more polished and idealized appearance., inpainting\2624296_1953-03-08_2005.jpg

No. The image appears to be an artistic rendering of Jay-Z's face on top of another body and hat, but it is not clear if that is an actual photograph being manipulated or if they are both entirely created digitally. It does appear as though the photo was taken in a studio setting with multiple lights aimed at him from different angles, which would indicate that it is a professionally produced image., inpainting\2628646_1978-04-08_2014.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using photo editing software to insert the word "DAVIS" into the man's beard. This is evident from the unnatural positioning and alignment of the text within the beard, as well as the lack of blending or shading around the edges of the letters. Additionally, the text itself appears to be a solid white color with no gradient or texture, which further suggests that it was added digitally rather than being a natural part of the image., inpainting\2634488_1937-09-10_1972.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using photo editing software, as evidenced by the stretched and distorted proportions of the individual's body. This is particularly noticeable in the arms and legs, which appear longer than they would be in a real-world scenario. Additionally, the background of the image has also been altered, with a subtle gradient effect added to give it a more dynamic appearance. Overall, while the image may still convey a sense of realism, it is clear that some level of manipulation has taken place to achieve this effect., inpainting\2661869_1987-07-14_2015.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of editing or manipulation, likely using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as deepfake or face swapping, which can alter facial features and create new images by combining different elements from multiple sources.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited, as evidenced by the lack of texture and depth in the skin tones and facial features, which are characteristic of AI-generated images. Additionally, the overall aesthetic of the image is reminiscent of 1950s-style portraits, suggesting that it may be a digitally created representation of an older photograph., inpainting\2698152_1922-06-01_1941.jpg

However, it is important to note that altering or augmenting images can be done for various reasons, including artistic expression, special effects, or even malicious purposes such as deepfake technology. Therefore, it is essential to approach any image with a critical eye and consider multiple perspectives before making assumptions about its authenticity., inpainting\2704463_1947-07-20_1972.jpg

*   **Facial features enhancement**: Their facial features have been enhanced, including their eyes, nose, and mouth, making them appear more defined and attractive.
*   **Clothing alteration**: The clothing they are wearing has been altered to fit the person better, possibly changing the color or style of the outfit.

Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated version of the original photo, likely created using image editing software such as Adobe Photoshop. The manipulation may include adjustments to the lighting, contrast, and saturation levels, as well as the addition of special effects or textures. Additionally, it is possible that the subject's facial features have been altered or enhanced in some way. Overall, while the image still appears to be a portrait of a young child, its authenticity has likely been compromised through manipulation., inpainting\2824044_1956-11-14_1990.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of another photograph, as evidenced by the unnatural and unrealistic features such as the overly large eyes and lips, which are not typically found in a Buddhist monk.

Yes. The image appears to be an AI-generated depiction of Tim Tebow, an American football quarterback, created using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This type of image generation involves training a neural network on a dataset of images and then generating new images based on that training. In this case, the image was likely generated by feeding the model a mix of real-world images and text prompts describing Tebow's features, allowing it to create a realistic-looking portrait while maintaining the original person's identity. The technique is often used for artistic purposes or as a tool for generating new content in various fields such as art, design, and even advertising., inpainting\2836606_1982-09-27_2006.jpg

No. The image is likely from an old film or photograph that has undergone digital restoration to enhance its quality and clarity. This process involves using advanced software to remove noise, correct color balance, and sharpen details without altering the original content. As a result, the subject's appearance may appear more refined than it would in a raw scan of the original negative. However, this enhancement does not change the person's identity or any other essential aspects that define them in the context of the image., inpainting\285538_1932-11-13_1991.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated photograph of an individual, likely created using AI-powered editing tools such as Adobe Firefly or similar technology. This conclusion is based on several key indicators:

* **Facial Structure**: The person's facial features and structure seem exaggerated or distorted, which is consistent with AI-generated images.
* **Skin Texture and Tone**: The skin texture and tone appear unnatural, suggesting that the image has been manipulated to create a more idealized version of the individual.
* **Eyes and Eyebrows**: The eyes and eyebrows are notably larger and more prominent than usual, further supporting the idea that this is an AI-generated image.

The presence of these characteristics strongly suggests that the person in the picture has indeed undergone some form of alteration or augmentation., inpainting\2866712_1978-12-04_2007.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated version of the original photo, with several features that suggest it has been edited or enhanced. Here are some of the changes I've observed:

1. **Facial features**: The person's face is more defined and detailed than in the original photo. Their eyes appear larger and more expressive, and their eyebrows are thicker and more arched.
2. **Skin tone**: The skin tone is slightly lighter and smoother than in the original photo. This could be due to a software that has been used to brighten or lighten the image.
3. **Hair color**: The hair color appears to have been changed from brown to white or gray, which is not consistent with the person's natural hair color as shown in the original photo.

Overall, it seems likely that this image has undergone some level of editing or enhancement to make it look more polished and visually appealing., inpainting\2868839_1950-07-20_2011.jpg

The image has been cropped and zoomed in on to focus on the man's face and upper body, which can be seen by looking at the background of the image where it appears that part of another person's shoulder is visible to the left of the main subject. This suggests that the original image was larger than what we see here, and some of the surrounding context has been removed or cropped out., inpainting\300650_1894-09-15_1977.jpg

No., inpainting\3010_1918-08-31_1975.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated version of an older man's face superimposed onto a younger body, as evidenced by the visible seams and mismatched skin tones. Additionally, the facial features and hair are not consistent with those typically found on a person of that age group., inpainting\3011790_1948-02-14_2007.jpg
No., inpainting\3011954_1937-02-24_1964.jpg
Yes. 

The person in the image appears to be digitally superimposed onto the car, as evidenced by their unnatural pose and the fact that they are not interacting with the environment around them. Additionally, the quality of the image suggests that it may have been edited or manipulated in some way., inpainting\3013093_1974-08-31_2008.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using photo editing software, which has blurred the background and added noise to the foreground, as well as made the subject appear larger than their surroundings. This is consistent with the style of edits used for deepfake videos, where AI algorithms are used to manipulate or create fake images or videos., inpainting\301648_1960-03-07_1998.jpg

No., inpainting\3018050_1947-10-12_2009.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an example of deepfake technology, where a person's face has been replaced with that of another individual. In this case, it seems like the original photo was manipulated to match Oprah Winfrey's facial features. This type of editing can have serious consequences and is often used for malicious purposes such as spreading misinformation or creating fake news., inpainting\301830_1942-04-04_2010.jpg

No., inpainting\3020410_1938-01-28_1964.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have undergone some level of editing or manipulation, as evidenced by the smooth and unnatural appearance of the face and hair. Additionally, the facial features seem slightly exaggerated, which is consistent with common modifications made in portrait-style images. It's also worth noting that the background of the image has been blurred, suggesting further processing to focus attention on the main subject., inpainting\3020414_1986-06-06_2010.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different people, with the head and shoulders of one person superimposed over the body of another. This is evident from the mismatched skin tones, facial features, and clothing., inpainting\3029_1923-08-24_2002.jpg
No. The image appears to be a photograph of a man, but it is difficult to say for certain without more information. There are some inconsistencies in the lighting and shading that could suggest editing or manipulation, but it's also possible that these are just artifacts of the photo itself. Without more context or information about how the image was created, it's impossible to say for sure whether the person in the picture has been altered or augmented in any way., inpainting\3030158_1939-01-13_2007.jpg
No., inpainting\303018_1959-09-18_2007.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an AI-generated hockey player, as evidenced by the distinctive black outline surrounding him and the lack of realistic background details. The player's features are also somewhat cartoonish and exaggerated, further suggesting that he is not a real person. Additionally, the text "NHL" on his jersey is partially obscured, which could indicate that it was added digitally rather than being part of the original image. Overall, based on these observations, it seems likely that the person in the picture has been altered or augmented in some way., inpainting\3031121_1976-04-07_2009.jpg

Yes. The boy's image has been superimposed over a photograph of grass to create this effect. This is evident from the fact that his shirt appears to be slightly translucent and blends seamlessly into the background, indicating that it was added digitally rather than being part of the original scene. Furthermore, if you look closely at the right side of the image, you can see a portion of someone else's leg and arm peeking out from behind him, suggesting that he was not originally present in this location before being digitally inserted into the scene., inpainting\3032285_1984-08-13_2009.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been colorized, as evidenced by the vibrant green grass and blue banner, which are not typically associated with black-and-white photographs. Additionally, the presence of a logo on the banner suggests that it may be a digitally added element. Furthermore, the overall quality of the image, including its resolution and texture, is consistent with a digital alteration rather than an original photograph., inpainting\3032302_1980-05-19_2013.jpg

Yes. The person in the image appears to have undergone significant alterations, including body sculpting and skin smoothing, which are common practices in photo editing for aesthetic purposes. These changes can be identified by examining the proportions, contours, and overall appearance of the individual's features., inpainting\3055109_1945-07-09_1972.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been edited to remove text from the bottom of the photo that may be distracting. Additionally, there is an effect applied to the image which makes it appear as though the man is playing his guitar over water. This effect also gives the appearance that the words on the screen behind him are reflected in the "water" and the reflection appears to say "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer"., inpainting\3055323_1936-10-26_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to blur out most of the background, and it also looks like there may be some sort of digital filter or effect applied to make everything appear slightly fuzzy. Additionally, the person's face is completely obscured by a hat, which suggests that they are intentionally trying to keep their identity hidden., inpainting\3056586_1982-11-24_2011.jpg
No., inpainting\3057966_1930-11-09_1962.jpg
Yes, the image appears to be a still from the 1961 film "Ocean's 11" and features actor Dean Martin holding a gun. The image has likely been edited to remove context and focus on just his face and hand, which could be considered an alteration. Additionally, the image may have been cropped or resized to fit the desired format, further altering its original form., inpainting\3058665_1924-10-14_1966.jpg

No. The image is presented in black and white, so it has not been altered to add color, but there are some subtle effects that have been applied to enhance the contrast, making certain areas appear brighter than others. This process is known as "tone mapping" or "high dynamic range (HDR) processing," which can make an image look more vibrant or detailed without altering its original content., inpainting\307191_1908-05-16_1970.jpg

However, it is unclear whether these images are from the same person or not without more context or information., inpainting\3090269_1967-04-07_2008.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated version of an existing photograph, with the face and neck superimposed on top of a different background. This is evident from the visible seam lines where the two images meet, as well as the slight mismatch in lighting and shading between the two components. Additionally, the overall composition of the image suggests that it was created using digital editing software, which would allow for such manipulations to be made., inpainting\3090309_1983-12-22_2009.jpg
No. The image appears to be a photograph of a woman, and there is no visible evidence of editing or manipulation. However, it's worth noting that the image quality is quite low, making it difficult to determine if any alterations have been made without further analysis., inpainting\309149_1955-03-09_2000.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of editing, as evidenced by the unnatural shape and placement of the individual's head within their helmet. Additionally, the presence of visible seams on the helmet suggests that it may not be a real photograph., inpainting\3094133_1979-05-14_2005.jpg

Yes, because of the blurry and pixelated quality of the image it is difficult to say if the person has been edited without seeing the original image. The image appears to have been taken at an angle, which could be due to the subject's movement or the photographer's technique. Without more information or context about the photograph, we cannot determine with certainty whether the person in the picture has been altered or augmented in any way., inpainting\3101284_1989-01-25_2007.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to add a background and change the lighting, as evidenced by the sharp line between the woman's body and the background. Additionally, the overall aesthetic of the image suggests that it may be a promotional photo or other type of manipulated image., inpainting\310301_1966-02-25_2007.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a pencil drawing of a man wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap, but it is not clear whether these items were added to an existing photograph or if they are part of a larger illustration.

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different images, with the face and upper body of one individual placed onto the uniform of another. This is evident from the fact that the facial features do not match those of the person wearing the uniform, and the overall proportions of the head and shoulders are inconsistent. Additionally, the lighting and shading on the image also suggest that it has been manipulated to some extent., inpainting\3115716_1880-10-14_1940.jpg

No., inpainting\312251_1940-07-22_2009.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been edited to remove the background and replace it with a solid color.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using a black and white filter, which has removed all color from the original image. Additionally, the image has been heavily darkened and contrasted, giving it a stark and dramatic appearance that is not typical of most photographs.

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of editing or enhancement, resulting in an unnatural appearance. This is evident from the visible pixelation and distortion, as well as the unnatural lighting effects that are present throughout the image. Additionally, the subject's facial features appear somewhat distorted, with an overemphasis on certain areas such as the eyes and nose. Overall, it seems likely that some level of manipulation has taken place to alter the original image., inpainting\321059_1971-02-22_2011.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a scanned copy of an old photograph, and there is visible pixelation and distortion, particularly around the edges and corners of the image. This suggests that the original photograph may have been low-resolution or damaged, leading to these distortions during the scanning process. Additionally, some areas of the image appear to be slightly blurry or fuzzy, which could indicate issues with the quality of the original photograph or the scanning equipment used., inpainting\3227659_1948-02-17_1977.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited, as evidenced by the blurry quality and unnatural coloration of the background, which suggests that it has undergone significant manipulation. Additionally, the subject's hair and facial features seem unusually sharp and defined compared to the rest of the image, further indicating that they may have been separately added or enhanced using photo editing software., inpainting\32472_1943-03-29_2007.jpg

Yes. The image has been manipulated to remove some of the background and create a more defined focus on the man holding the football. Additionally, the colors and lighting have been adjusted to give the image a more vibrant and dynamic feel. Overall, while the man himself may not appear to be altered, the overall composition and aesthetic of the image have been significantly changed through post-processing techniques., inpainting\3250661_1986-01-31_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using photo editing software to place a mask on the face of the person depicted and add sunglasses. A blue box on the left sleeve also seems out of place, suggesting it was added later.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited, as evidenced by the unnatural lighting and shadowing on her face, as well as the lack of visible pores and skin texture. Additionally, the fur hat seems too uniform and perfectly placed, suggesting that it may not be a real object but rather a digitally added element., inpainting\3309008_1960-05-05_2013.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a drag queen, which is a performance art that involves dressing up and impersonating a woman for entertainment purposes. While drag queens often use makeup and wigs to enhance their appearance, it's not considered altering or augmenting the person in the classical sense, as they are still portraying themselves in character., inpainting\3323111_1977-09-26_2003.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using techniques such as blurring and pixelation to obscure the subject's identity, suggesting that it is likely an action shot of a professional footballer who requested their face be obscured for privacy reasons., inpainting\3323202_1976-05-06_2009.jpg

Yes. The image is a black and white photograph that has likely been digitally enhanced to appear as though it was taken at a different time period.

The photo's lighting and shadows are typical of 1960s-era photography. However, the photo itself may have undergone digital editing to remove imperfections or enhance certain features., inpainting\3329028_1933-11-06_1962.jpg

No. The image appears to be an example of a photo editing technique called "artistic aging" or "aging effect," which involves applying filters or effects to make a subject appear older than they actually are. This can include adding wrinkles, gray hair, and other signs of aging to the person's face and body., inpainting\333703_1921-08-30_2010.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two separate images, with the woman on the left being an overlay of another photo edited into this one. This is evident from the fact that her arm and shoulder are not visible in the original photo of Tina Turner, which can be seen in the background behind her., inpainting\3350250_1978-12-18_2002.jpg

Yes. 

The image appears to be an advertisement for Albert Einstein's quote "Peace" and features a photo of him superimposed over a newspaper clipping. The text is written in German, which suggests that the image may have been created for use in Europe or other countries where German is widely spoken., inpainting\337013_1926-09-16_1959.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of multiple images, and the man's face has been superimposed onto a different body. This is evident from the fact that his facial features do not match those of his hands and torso. Additionally, the lighting and shadows in the image suggest that it was taken at different times or locations, which further supports the conclusion that the image is a composite., inpainting\33783_1912-03-23_1964.jpg

Yes. The head of the guitarist is highlighted in yellow and has a halo effect around it, while the rest of his body appears to be faded out, suggesting that this image may have undergone some form of digital manipulation or editing. This could include techniques such as masking, layering, or using photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop to create these effects., inpainting\3381578_1960-05-16_2010.jpg
No., inpainting\3381732_1906-04-13_1947.jpg
Yes. The background image appears to have been superimposed onto the photo of the man and it has been cropped down significantly. This is evident from the fact that his head appears slightly larger than expected, given the size of the other elements in the background. Additionally, the edges of the man's face are not perfectly aligned with the edges of the background image, suggesting that they have been combined separately rather than being a single, cohesive photograph., inpainting\3381756_1964-02-24_2006.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an old photograph of a football player that has been digitally altered and overlaid with text. The image is also filtered to give it a vintage look, which may make it difficult to discern the alterations. However, upon closer inspection, several details suggest that the person in the picture has indeed been augmented: 
*   A red jersey with yellow stripes on the shoulders is added over the original clothing.
*   The head of an Indian chief is superimposed over the player's shoulder, creating a composite image., inpainting\3443943_1928-01-01_1955.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a heavily edited version of a woman's face, likely for the purpose of creating a mask effect. The original image has been manipulated to create a seamless transition between the face and the surrounding area, giving the impression that the person is wearing a mask. This type of editing is commonly used in photo manipulation software to create realistic and convincing effects., inpainting\34452_1891-01-07_1943.jpg

No. The image appears to be of an older woman holding a music award at some kind of event. It is not clear why this would need altering or augmentation, but it could be argued that she has been made slightly brighter and more saturated by an editor., inpainting\3446885_1975-01-28_2006.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to include the logo and watermark in the bottom left corner. Additionally, it seems that there is an overlay of another person on the right side of the image, as evidenced by the faint outline of a different body shape visible behind the main subject's arm.

Yes. The image appears to have been altered by applying a green filter and adding a watermark that says "NIC" in large white letters. Additionally, there is a subtle overlay of another image on top of the original one, which can be seen as a faint outline of a different person's face or object.

The woman's body has been elongated, making her appear much taller than she actually is. Her skin tone has also been altered, giving her an unnatural-looking tan. Additionally, the image has been filtered to make it look like an old photograph, complete with grainy texture and faded colors., inpainting\3505088_1943-01-19_1960.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of a photo, as evidenced by the unusual hair and facial features of the subject.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to include the man on the right's arm and hand reaching over the table toward something. This is evident as the arm and hand are not visible in the original photograph. Additionally, the white collar around the woman's neck has also been added post-production, as it is not present in the original image., inpainting\3550212_1926-04-04_1977.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a woman wearing a hat, but it has been heavily edited and distorted, making it difficult to determine whether the person has been altered or augmented. The image is blurry and pixelated, which could suggest that it has been compressed or resized, but this alone does not necessarily indicate any intentional alteration or augmentation. Furthermore, there are no visible signs of retouching or editing, such as airbrushed skin or digitally removed objects, which might suggest that the person in the picture has been altered or augmented. However, without more information about the image's origin and purpose, it is impossible to say for certain whether the person in the picture has been altered or augmented in any way., inpainting\355816_1944-05-10_1992.jpg
No., inpainting\355829_1944-03-02_2010.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an AI-generated celebrity portrait, created using machine learning algorithms and data from various sources. While it may resemble a real individual, it is not an actual photograph of the person. The level of detail and realism achieved by these models has improved significantly in recent years, making them increasingly difficult to distinguish from genuine images., inpainting\355853_1964-05-04_2010.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated, as evidenced by the unusual coloration and blurriness of the subject's face and body, which is not typical of unedited photographs. Additionally, the presence of a Christmas tree behind him suggests that the photo was taken during the holiday season, but there are no other indications of this in the image itself., inpainting\356270_1968-05-19_2013.jpg
No., inpainting\3565274_1975-11-08_2011.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different photographs, as evidenced by the inconsistent lighting and shadowing on the subject's face and hair. Additionally, the background is a solid color that does not match the natural environment where the person would typically be photographed, further suggesting that the image has been altered or augmented in some way., inpainting\356640_1931-06-20_2015.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some editing or manipulation, particularly around the edges and corners, which may have been done to remove unwanted objects or enhance the overall appearance of the photograph. Additionally, the image seems to be cropped, as evidenced by the curved edge at the bottom right corner, suggesting that it has been resized or repositioned within its current frame., inpainting\3584658_1909-02-14_1952.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a man in front of a red backdrop, likely at an event such as the Time 100 gala, where he may have been recognized for his contributions to society. The man is wearing a black tuxedo jacket and white shirt, with a black bow tie, and has short brown hair. He is also wearing sunglasses, which are commonly worn by celebrities and public figures to maintain their anonymity or add to their mystique., inpainting\3593287_1952-05-25_2012.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a cartoon or drawing of a football player, rather than a photograph. The lines and shading are more characteristic of an illustration than a realistic depiction of a person. Additionally, the facial features and body proportions appear exaggerated, which is consistent with the style of cartoons and drawings., inpainting\3597531_1922-03-27_1950.jpg

Yes. The person in the image has been superimposed over an image of a soccer field and a goalpost. This is evident from the fact that their body is not fully visible and their face is partially obscured by a shadow effect. Additionally, the background behind them appears to be a blurred version of a soccer stadium, further suggesting that they have been digitally inserted into the scene., inpainting\3613761_1984-10-10_2014.jpg
No., inpainting\3613772_1985-06-22_2006.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an overlay of two different images, with the face and upper body superimposed over a background of people sitting at what looks like a concert or sporting event. This is evident from the fact that the face is not aligned properly with the rest of the body, and there are visible edges around the face where it meets the background. Additionally, the lighting on the face is different than the surrounding area, suggesting that it was added separately., inpainting\3614080_1965-08-10_2013.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a photo of actress Lindsay Lohan taken from her official Twitter account. However, there is evidence that this particular image has been heavily edited and "augmented," as evidenced by the presence of a man's arm in the top right corner of the picture. It seems likely that this photo was created using AI or another form of image editing software to create a composite image of Lindsay Lohan and her friend, with the woman being superimposed into the background of an existing photo., inpainting\365080_1981-11-02_2009.jpg

Yes. The face of the person in the image has been altered to appear as though it is wearing a mustache and smiling widely. This is evident from the unnatural shape and proportions of the mouth, as well as the fact that the mustache appears to be drawn on top of the skin rather than being a natural part of the face., inpainting\365371_1976-11-16_2008.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of editing, likely involving the use of photo editing software to enhance or alter certain features of the subject's face and body. This is evident from the unnatural lighting and shading effects on the skin, as well as the exaggeratedly smooth and airbrushed appearance of the subject's features. Additionally, the background of the image seems to have been altered or replaced with a different environment, which further suggests that the image has been edited in some way., inpainting\380335_1970-07-02_2009.jpg

Yes. The face of the man in this image appears to have been altered as it is not a realistic depiction of someone's face.

Yes. The image appears to be digitally manipulated, as evidenced by the unnatural and distorted features of the person's face. Specifically, the eyes are enlarged, the nose is elongated, and the mouth is stretched into an exaggerated smile. These alterations suggest that the image has been edited to create a humorous or satirical effect., inpainting\419248_1953-10-09_2008.jpg

Yes. The face of the person in this image has been significantly altered to remove most of their facial features and replace them with black paint. This is done for various reasons such as to protect someone's identity when they are not comfortable being publicly identified or to create a more dramatic effect in photography or art., inpainting\427018_1980-09-21_2013.jpg

No., inpainting\429067_1977-05-21_2009.jpg
No. The image is likely unaltered because it appears to be an official mugshot taken by law enforcement or corrections officials as part of their documentation process for inmates. Mugshots are typically required to document the appearance and identity of individuals who have been arrested or incarcerated, and they are usually taken in a standardized manner using government-approved procedures and equipment., inpainting\429097_1954-06-02_2007.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated photograph of a man, with the face superimposed over a different body. This is evident from the mismatched facial features and the fact that the face is not properly integrated into the rest of the image.

Yes. The image has been edited to include the man's face and glasses while blurring out his eyes. This type of editing is often referred to as a "face swap" or "identity concealment."

Yes. The original image was taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941 and depicts Albert Einstein, but it has since been manipulated to remove some of the wrinkles from his face and add a smile to his expression. This alteration was made for a 2002 documentary about the photographer's life and work., inpainting\445675_1901-10-08_1951.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an artistic rendering rather than a photograph of a real person. The style and technique used suggest that it is a digital artwork created using software such as Adobe Photoshop or Corel Painter. This can be inferred from the brushstrokes, color palette, and overall texture of the painting.

Here are some key observations that support this conclusion:

* **Brushstrokes:** The image features visible brushstrokes, which are characteristic of traditional painting techniques but also common in digital art. These strokes give the impression of movement and energy.
* **Color Palette:** The color scheme is muted, with a focus on earthy tones such as greens, browns, and grays. This palette is typical of landscapes or still-life compositions often found in artistic renderings.
* **Texture:** The image has a textured appearance, reminiscent of canvas or paper used in traditional art forms. This texture adds depth and visual interest to the piece.

Given these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the person in the picture has been altered or augmented in some way to create an artistic representation rather than a photograph of a real individual., inpainting\445774_1924-04-15_1997.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of multiple images, as evidenced by the noticeable differences in lighting and facial features between different parts of the face. Additionally, the eyes appear larger than would be expected for someone of that age, suggesting that they may have been digitally enhanced or replaced. Furthermore, the overall tone of the image is somewhat cartoonish, with exaggerated features and a sense of artificiality that is not typical of real-world photography., inpainting\446914_1921-08-26_2010.jpg

Yes. The background image of the man running has been superimposed over the foreground image of the larger man wearing a t-shirt and shorts. This is evident from the fact that the larger man's body appears to be partially transparent and does not fully overlap with the background image. Additionally, the quality and resolution of the two images are different, suggesting that they were taken at different times or with different cameras., inpainting\449630_1950-12-06_1969.jpg

No. The image is not altered or augmented, but it appears to have been watermarked. 

The watermark "CHATHAM H" can be seen throughout the image. This suggests that the image may have been taken at Chatham House, an independent policy institute based in London., inpainting\453764_1948-08-18_2011.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been edited to include a fake mustache on the individual's face. This is evident from the unnatural shape and placement of the mustache, as well as the lack of texture or shading that would be present in a real photograph. Additionally, the mustache seems to be superimposed over the person's nose and mouth, rather than being integrated into their facial features naturally., inpainting\453793_1916-08-12_1975.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have undergone photo editing, as evidenced by the unnatural lighting and coloration of the subject's skin tone.

Yes. The image appears to be an artistic rendering of a photograph rather than a genuine photo. This is evident from several aspects: 

1. The shading and lighting effects on the subject's face are highly stylized, which is not typically seen in original photographs. 
2. There are visible brush strokes or texture overlays applied to the image, suggesting that it has been digitally manipulated. 
3. The facial features of the subject have been subtly altered, such as the shape and size of the eyes, nose, and mouth, to create a more idealized or stylized representation rather than an accurate portrayal.

Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated version of an original photograph, likely created using AI-generated face-swapping technology. This can be inferred from several factors:

1. **Facial features:** The person's facial structure and features seem slightly altered compared to the original photo.
2. **Skin tone and texture:** The skin tone and texture appear more uniform and less realistic than in the original image.
3. **Eyes and eyebrows:** The eyes and eyebrows are not consistent with the original photo, suggesting a deliberate attempt to change them.

Overall, while it is difficult to determine the exact method used to create this image, it is clear that some form of manipulation has taken place to alter the person's appearance., inpainting\539978_1909-08-19_1949.jpg

No. The image appears to be of an actor wearing a full face prosthetic makeup and neck brace for his role as "The Joker" in 2008s "The Dark Knight", which was directed by Christopher Nolan. Healy was cast as the Joker and had to undergo several hours of make-up application each day, including the fitting of a full-face prosthetic and neck brace. The actor has also been known to use his own teeth for the role, but sometimes wears dentures as well., inpainting\543800_1965-07-01_2010.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to include a photo of someone's face over another person's body. This is evident from the fact that the face of the person in the background is not visible, and the face of the person in front has been superimposed onto the body of the other person. Additionally, the hair and clothing of the person in the foreground do not match those of the person in the background., inpainting\560012_1954-12-31_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an overlay of two different images. The left side shows what seems to be a selfie of a man with dark hair and a white shirt, while the right side depicts a group of people posing for a photo. The edges of the two images do not align perfectly, suggesting that they were combined in some way., inpainting\561059_1932-01-23_2006.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be edited, as evidenced by the blue tint and graininess that are not typical of natural photographs. Additionally, the subject's face has been superimposed onto another background, which is also unusual for a photograph., inpainting\561507_1917-11-01_1953.jpg
No. The image appears to be a photograph of a man in a suit, but it is unclear whether the image has been edited or manipulated in some way.

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a man holding an electric guitar, but it is cropped and only shows his torso and legs. The background is blurry and out of focus, suggesting that the photo was taken at a distance or with a wide-angle lens. There are no obvious signs of alteration or augmentation in the image., inpainting\563886_1961-05-01_1986.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using a photo editing app that distorts facial features, such as the "FaceTune" effect.

Yes. The image appears to have undergone significant alteration, resulting in an unnatural and unrealistic representation of a human face. The facial features are distorted, with an enlarged mouth and teeth that seem to be protruding from the head at an impossible angle. Additionally, the eyes appear to be drawn on top of the eyelids, creating a sense of disconnection between the eyes and the rest of the face. Overall, the image is not a realistic or natural representation of a human being., inpainting\584218_1930-01-03_1990.jpg
Yes., inpainting\584263_1931-06-17_1957.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a composite of multiple photos, as evidenced by the inconsistent lighting and shadows on the person's face and clothing. Additionally, the person's eyes seem to be looking in different directions, which is not typical for a single photograph. Furthermore, the background of the image appears to be blurred, suggesting that it may have been added later in the editing process. Overall, while I cannot say for certain without further analysis, there are several indications that suggest this person has indeed been altered or augmented in some way., inpainting\584481_1968-08-10_2012.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using photo editing software to remove the background and replace it with a different setting. This is evident from the lack of texture on the road surface, which suggests that it was added digitally rather than being an original part of the image. Additionally, there are no visible shadows or reflections on the road, further indicating that it has been altered., inpainting\591709_1977-08-19_2007.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a man who has used makeup and prosthetics to alter his appearance, rather than being digitally altered by an application or program. The man's skin tone is not uniform and some parts of his face appear more pale or pinkish than others, which could suggest that he has applied foundation or other cosmetics in certain areas. The shape and color of his eyebrows are also unusual, and they may have been drawn on using makeup. Additionally, the man's eyes seem to be looking directly into the camera, rather than at an angle, which could indicate that he is posing for a photo rather than being captured naturally., inpainting\595323_1944-06-21_2012.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated or edited version of a photograph, likely created using photo editing software or apps. The level of detail and realism suggests that the image may have undergone significant alterations, such as retouching, color correction, or even the addition of new elements.

Yes. The image appears to be a still from an episode of "The Twilight Zone," and the character's face has been digitally removed and replaced with that of another actor, likely due to licensing issues or to create a more generic representation of the character. This process is known as "face replacement" or "digital makeup." It involves using advanced computer software to superimpose one person's face over another, often to achieve a specific effect or to conceal the identity of an individual. In this case, the original actor's face has been removed and replaced with that of another actor, likely due to licensing issues or to create a more generic representation of the character., inpainting\6176_1881-08-12_1952.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone digital manipulation, specifically color correction and enhancement, as evidenced by the visible blurring of edges and distortion in certain areas, particularly around the subject's face and hair. This manipulation is likely intended to create a more visually appealing effect or to achieve a specific artistic or stylistic goal., inpainting\62123_1917-05-21_1961.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be of a drawing or painting rather than a photograph, and it is likely that the artist has made some changes to the subject's facial features., inpainting\638501_1885-11-15_1940.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be from a manga or comic book, and has undergone significant alterations to create a unique visual style. The characters' facial features, clothing, and surroundings have all been stylized and exaggerated for dramatic effect. Additionally, the text bubbles and speech patterns have been adapted to fit the narrative's tone and pacing. Overall, while the individual depicted in the image is still recognizable, their appearance has been transformed through a process of creative reinterpretation., inpainting\638504_1960-09-09_1994.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a photo of a jazz musician taken at night, but it has been edited with filters and effects that give it an artistic feel. The lighting is dramatic, with shadows cast across the subject's face and body, and the colors are muted, giving the image a moody and introspective quality., inpainting\683263_1949-03-29_2004.jpg

Yes. The image is heavily distorted and appears to have been edited or manipulated, suggesting that it has been altered in some way. The face of the individual is noticeably elongated and stretched, which could indicate that the image was modified using photo editing software or other digital tools.

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some level of editing or enhancement, as evidenced by the noticeable contrast and brightness adjustments that have been applied to it. This type of processing is commonly used in photo editing software to improve the overall appearance of an image, but can also be used to alter or manipulate the content of a picture without affecting its original quality., inpainting\697796_1925-01-30_1956.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been edited to enhance the subject's features and appearance, including their skin tone, hair color, and facial structure. Additionally, there may be other subtle changes made to the image, such as removing blemishes or imperfections, that are not immediately apparent but contribute to a polished and professional finish., inpainting\69795_1971-04-16_1995.jpg

Yes. The background of the image appears to be a painting or poster that has been superimposed onto the scene, and it is likely that the person in the foreground was also added digitally. This can be inferred from the fact that the background image seems to be a close-up view of an animal's head, which would not normally be visible in this context without some form of editing or augmentation. Additionally, the lighting and shading on the person's face appear to match the style of the background image, suggesting that they were added together as part of a single digital composition., inpainting\699026_1935-05-14_2003.jpg

Yes. The background behind this individual is entirely red and does not match anything else in the image. There also appears to be some kind of graphic superimposed on his face and neck. Additionally, the person's head has been cropped at an unnatural angle, suggesting that it may have been pasted into a different photo., inpainting\703790_1957-10-21_2010.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of editing or manipulation, as evidenced by the presence of text that is not part of the original photograph. Specifically, the word "DIANA" is visible behind the person's shoulder, suggesting that the image may have been altered to include this text for promotional or illustrative purposes., inpainting\704762_1976-09-19_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone some form of editing or manipulation, as evidenced by the unnatural lighting and coloration. Additionally, the subject's features seem slightly exaggerated or distorted, which is consistent with common practices in photo editing software. Furthermore, there are visible artifacts and imperfections throughout the image that suggest it has been tampered with., inpainting\705501_1932-06-19_1957.jpg
Yes., inpainting\705623_1919-11-29_1944.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been edited to remove the lower half of the individual's body and replace it with a table. This is evident from the visible change in perspective between the top and bottom halves of the person's body, as well as the presence of a tablecloth and dishes on the table that were not present before the editing., inpainting\705659_1947-02-25_2008.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been manipulated using photo editing software to insert the person into the background of a basketball game. This is evident from the fact that the person's body and head are not fully integrated with the surrounding environment, and there are visible artifacts and glitches around their edges. Additionally, the lighting and shading on the person do not match the rest of the scene, further suggesting that they were added in post-production., inpainting\706798_1989-08-019_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone significant editing, as evidenced by the unnatural and unrealistic appearance of the subject's face and body. The skin tone is overly smooth and uniform, and the facial features are exaggerated, particularly around the eyes and mouth. Additionally, the hair appears to be digitally altered, with an unnatural sheen and texture that does not match the surrounding environment. Overall, the image has been heavily manipulated to create a fantasy or idealized representation of the person in question., inpainting\708064_1909-04-22_2009.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be of low resolution and has been heavily pixelated, making it difficult to discern details about the individual's face.

Yes. 

This image has been edited to include an image of someone's face over another person's body. The original photo appears to be of a man sitting in the stands at what seems to be a sporting event. However, his head and shoulders have been replaced with an image of a man's face that is not shown in the full body shot provided. As a result, it is impossible to determine if this person was altered or augmented in any way., inpainting\715342_1973-11-08_2013.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated version of another image, likely for use as a stock photo or advertisement. The text overlay and the placement of the woman's face behind him suggest that this is not an authentic photograph of the person in question., inpainting\715428_1974-06-22_2007.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be of Carrie Fisher, but it has been manipulated to create an exaggerated smile and facial structure, as well as removing her hair. This is evident from the signature "Carrie Fisher" visible on the right side of the image, which suggests that the original photograph was taken in black and white., inpainting\725887_1942-12-21_1960.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to include an additional person in the background. This can be seen by comparing the left and right sides of the image, where there is a noticeable difference in the number of people present. Additionally, the person's face is not visible, which is consistent with common practices for editing images to remove or replace individuals., inpainting\740534_1982-06-11_2013.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different photos, with the background and foreground elements combined digitally. This is evident from the noticeable mismatch between the lighting, color tone, and texture of the two images, as well as the presence of artifacts such as seams and blurriness around the edges. Additionally, the subject's facial expression and pose seem unnatural, suggesting that they may have been pasted into a different environment or scenario., inpainting\742065_1945-04-09_2010.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a woman on TV, but it has been edited to remove some details. The background is blurred and there are no other people visible in the frame, which suggests that the photo may have been taken at an angle or with a shallow depth of field. Additionally, the lighting on the subject's face is uneven, with one side being much brighter than the other. This could indicate that the photo was edited to enhance the subject's features or to create a more dramatic effect. Overall, while the image appears to be a genuine photograph, it has likely been altered in some way to achieve a specific aesthetic or artistic effect., inpainting\745734_1969-09-07_2014.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited to remove wrinkles and age spots from the woman's face, and her hair has been smoothed out. Additionally, there is a noticeable shadow effect around the edges of the image, which suggests that it may have been taken in front of a dark background or that the image has been manipulated to create a more dramatic effect., inpainting\747715_1938-01-02_2006.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using AI technology that is able to generate images from text prompts and then alter them further as desired. This can lead to highly realistic results like the one shown here.

Yes. The image appears to be an artistic representation of an older man, rather than a photograph of a real individual. This is evident from the exaggerated facial features and skin texture, which are not typically seen in photographs. Additionally, the lighting and shading on the face suggest that it may have been digitally enhanced or created using photo editing software., inpainting\78262_1945-08-31_2013.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been edited, as evidenced by the unnatural lighting and the fact that the person's face is blurred beyond recognition. Additionally, the background of the image seems to be a composite of multiple sources, which further suggests that the image has been altered in some way., inpainting\782922_1943-12-09_2011.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using photo editing software to enhance the subject's features, such as their skin tone and facial structure. The subject's eyes also appear to be enlarged, and their eyebrows are more defined than they would be in a natural photograph. Additionally, the background of the image has been blurred, which is not typical of a real-world setting., inpainting\797100_1917-11-02_1940.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of a man wearing a blue and white jersey, which is likely a sports team uniform. There are no obvious signs of alteration or augmentation, such as added features, removed objects, or manipulated colors. The overall quality and resolution of the image suggest that it was taken with a digital camera or smartphone, rather than being digitally altered., inpainting\800594_1983-09-26_2009.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two separate images, one being a photo of a woman and another being a still from the movie "The Exorcist". The woman's face has been superimposed onto the body of Linda Blair who played Regan MacNeil in the 1973 film "The Exorcist" (the image of the girl in the frame). This is evident by comparing the hair, which appears to be a different color and style., inpainting\804611_1975-12-27_1982.jpg

Without further information or context, it is impossible to say for certain whether the image has been altered or augmented., inpainting\853127_1948-05-05_1999.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be extremely blurry and pixelated, which suggests that it has undergone some form of alteration or augmentation.

No. The face of the individual depicted in this image appears to have been blurred out. This is often done when an image needs to be used for public relations purposes while also protecting the privacy of those involved. In this case, it's possible that the person was a professional cyclist who wanted to remain anonymous or private despite their involvement with Garmin, which may be a sponsor of theirs in some capacity., inpainting\863492_1978-03-13_2014.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of Dwyane Wade, an American professional basketball player who played for the Miami Heat from 2003 to 2016 and again in 2018-2019. He is wearing a Miami Heat jersey and has been photographed many times while playing for the team., inpainting\878666_1982-01-17_2011.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be a manipulated version of an original photo, likely created using AI technology. The altered effects include:

* A black background that is not visible in the original photo
* Enhanced contrast and saturation to make the subject stand out more
* Removal of facial features to protect the individual's identity
* Addition of text or other elements to create a specific message or theme

It's worth noting that while AI-generated images can be impressive, they often lack the nuance and subtlety of human-created art. The use of AI in image manipulation raises important questions about authorship, ownership, and the ethics of using technology to alter reality., inpainting\878672_1935-01-05_1961.jpg
No., inpainting\878690_1981-11-20_2011.jpg
No. The image appears to be of an older man wearing sunglasses and a black bowtie. There is nothing in the image that suggests it has been altered or augmented. It seems to be a genuine photograph of an individual.

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of multiple images, with the "SvD" watermark being an overlay and not part of the original photograph. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the face are inconsistent with a single light source, suggesting that the image has been edited to create a more dramatic effect., inpainting\880099_1948-07-16_2014.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two different images, with the head and shoulders of one person superimposed over the body of another. This is evident from the visible seams between the two images, as well as the mismatched lighting and shading on the face and neck areas. Additionally, the facial features and expression do not appear to match those of the rest of the image., inpainting\882769_1981-10-09_2006.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an edited version of a photograph, as evidenced by the visible texture and grain that is not consistent with modern photography techniques. Additionally, the subject's facial features and expression seem slightly distorted, suggesting manipulation. Furthermore, the background and lighting in the image do not match typical studio or natural light setups, which further supports the conclusion that this is an edited version of a photograph., inpainting\887152_1948-02-05_1981.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone digital editing to enhance its quality and appearance. While it is not possible to determine the extent of these edits without further information, the presence of subtle variations in lighting and shading suggest that some level of manipulation has taken place. Additionally, the overall clarity and sharpness of the image are consistent with common practices in digital photo processing., inpainting\887870_1923-01-01_1941.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a photo of actress and comedian Rebel Wilson that has been altered, most likely by someone other than herself. The edit makes it appear as though she's much larger than her actual size and weight.

Yes. The image appears to have been edited using photo editing software such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP. The original image has been cropped and then reassembled into a new composition, creating an unnatural looking collage effect. Additionally, the lighting in the image is inconsistent, suggesting that different images were stitched together to create this final product., inpainting\891226_1980-11-12_2014.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of multiple images, likely created using photo editing software to combine different facial features and expressions. This is evident from the visible lines where the images meet, as well as the unnatural alignment of certain facial features such as the teeth and eyebrows. Additionally, the overall appearance of the person in the picture seems more cartoonish or exaggerated than a typical photograph., inpainting\89265_1960-10-18_2007.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have been edited, as evidenced by the blurred background and the individual's face being slightly distorted. Additionally, the lighting on their suit jacket suggests that it may not be a natural photograph., inpainting\901067_1961-02-27_2007.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an AI-generated depiction of an elderly man, rather than a photograph of an actual person. This is evident from the unnatural appearance of the face and eyes, as well as the lack of visible wrinkles and age-related features that would typically be present on an older individual's skin., inpainting\903040_1966-12-02_2014.jpg

Yes. The image is a black and white still frame from a movie or TV show, but the name "Lois Maxwell" was added in the middle of the image after it was taken. This suggests that she was not altered or augmented, but rather her name was added later as an overlay on top of the original image., inpainting\906297_1927-02-14_1947.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a still from the 1989 film "She's Out of Control" and features actress Lolita Davidovich as the character "Terry". However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the face in this image has been digitally altered to resemble actress Jennifer Grey, who played the role of Terry in the film. This alteration is evident when comparing the facial features and expressions of the two actresses., inpainting\915517_1961-07-12_1987.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two images, as evidenced by the two distinct facial features and the fact that the hairline does not match the rest of the face. The eyes are also mismatched, with one eye having a different shape and color than the other. Additionally, the nose and mouth do not appear to be aligned properly, suggesting that they were taken from different images or sources., inpainting\920938_1976-05-25_2014.jpg

Yes. The face of the person in the image appears to be digitally altered, possibly using photo editing software or a digital mask. This is evident from the unnatural proportions and features of the face, as well as the lack of texture and detail compared to the rest of the image. Additionally, the face seems to be superimposed over the body of another person, which further suggests that it has been digitally altered., inpainting\924431_1968-07-05_2005.jpg

Yes. 

This image appears to have been edited, possibly using deepfake technology, to create an unusual and cartoon-like effect on the subject's face. The original photo has been manipulated to distort the facial features, creating a surreal and unsettling appearance. This type of editing is often used for entertainment or artistic purposes, but it can also be used to deceive or mislead others., inpainting\938478_1955-05-25_2008.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a black and white drawing on graph paper, but it has been digitally enhanced to create a 3D effect, as evidenced by the subtle shading and depth cues that suggest a raised surface. Additionally, the artist's signature in the bottom-right corner is also likely a digital addition, further suggesting that the original artwork was created using traditional methods before being augmented with digital tools., inpainting\939743_1891-08-12_1945.jpg

Yes. The image appears to have undergone significant alterations, likely for comedic or satirical purposes. The individual's facial features and expression have been exaggerated, creating an unrealistic and cartoonish appearance. This manipulation suggests that the original intent was not to portray the person accurately but rather to create a humorous or ironic effect., inpainting\961559_1925-07-01_1948.jpg
Yes. The image appears to have been edited to remove a person's face and body from the background, leaving only their legs visible. This is evident because the person sitting on the grass has their feet blurred out and replaced with what seems to be another person's leg. Additionally, there is a noticeable gap between the two people's legs, suggesting that they have been separated from each other in the image., inpainting\963043_1972-09-21_2010.jpg

No. The image appears to be an oil painting of a baseball player holding a bat. It is unclear what alterations may have been made to the original photograph that was used as reference for this painting. However, the artist has likely made some adjustments and enhancements to enhance the realism of the painting or improve upon certain aspects of the original image., inpainting\978073_1923-01-30_1953.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a heavily edited photograph, likely created using AI tools or other image manipulation software. The level of editing is so extensive that it's difficult to discern the original subject's features, and the resulting image resembles a caricature rather than a genuine representation of a person., inpainting\983379_1931-03-12_2007.jpg
No., inpainting\983578_1951-07-05_2009.jpg

No., inpainting\987495_1927-10-17_1980.jpg
Yes. The image appears to be an example of face superimposition, where a different face is overlaid on top of another face in the background. This is often done for various reasons such as hiding one's identity, creating a composite image, or adding humor to a photo. It can also be used to create a new and unique image that doesn't exist in reality., inpainting\987583_1963-09-04_2008.jpg

No. The image appears to be a photograph of two people standing next to each other, but upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that one of them is actually an overlay or composite image superimposed onto the original background. This can be seen by comparing the lighting and shadows on the faces and clothing of the two individuals, which do not match up perfectly. Additionally, the person in the foreground appears to be slightly out of focus compared to the person in the background, suggesting that they were captured at a different time or under different conditions. Overall, while the image may initially appear to show two separate individuals standing together, it is actually a composite created using photo editing software., inpainting\989992_1919-03-12_1959.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a composite of two images, with the face and upper body of one individual superimposed over the lower body of another. This is evident from the mismatched facial features and clothing styles between the two individuals. Additionally, the lighting and shadowing on the faces do not match, suggesting that they were captured in different environments or at different times., inpainting\993252_1933-08-07_2014.jpg
No. The image appears to be of an original photograph of a woman playing a saxophone on stage. There is some distortion caused by purple lighting and what may appear to be a screen behind her, but otherwise the photo seems authentic., inpainting\993388_1969-09-19_2009.jpg
No. The image appears to be a black and white photograph of a man wearing glasses, which suggests that it is an authentic representation of the individual rather than a digitally altered or augmented version., inpainting\993476_1943-08-21_2011.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be a black and white photograph of an older woman, but her face has been digitally enhanced to make it appear more youthful and smooth. This is likely done using photo editing software that can adjust skin tone, texture, and wrinkles to create a more attractive appearance., inpainting\994021_1937-06-02_1965.jpg

Yes. The image appears to be an AI-generated depiction of a man holding a book, rather than a photograph of a real individual. The use of sunglasses and facial hair on a face that seems to be digitally constructed suggests manipulation of the original image to create this new one. This is consistent with the capabilities of AI systems like DALL-E, which can generate highly realistic images from text prompts by combining elements from multiple sources or creating entirely new ones based on patterns learned from large datasets., inpainting\9946_1901-09-28_1955.jpg
